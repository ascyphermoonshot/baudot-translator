# baudot-translator
here there will be a collection of files regarding baudot encoding, eventually there will be a script that accepts an image, transforms it to a simplified form of ASCII-art, encrypts it and outputs an audio file.
So far I have the script to translate text into Baudot characters and the script to transform image into Baudot art
